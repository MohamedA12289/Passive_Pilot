# Passive Pilot — Frontend 5

## What changed from Frontend 4
- Added **Process** page (`/process`) showing the user workflow step-by-step.
- Added **Templates** page (`/templates`) with mock UI layouts for your slides / pitch deck.
- Dashboard now includes a **Quick start** box with links to Process/Settings/Billing.
- Subscription gate allowlist now includes Process + Templates so users can see it even if they’re not subscribed yet.
